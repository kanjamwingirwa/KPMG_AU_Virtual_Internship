# KPMG_AU_Virtual_Internship
This is a project done as part of the kpmg virtual internship offered on forage. This google collab is the final workbook for the internship.
I was provided with an excel sheet with several sheets each explaining something different. The sheets included are : transactions, customer demographic and customer addresses.
A separate sheet is named new customer list. I should then determine which among the people in the new customer list are potential customers given the past data already provided.
