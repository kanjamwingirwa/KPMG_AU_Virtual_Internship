# KPMG_AU_Virtual_Internship
This is a project done as part of the kpmg virtual internship offered on forage. This google collab is the final workbook for the internship.
I was provided with an excel sheet with several sheets each explaining something different. The sheets included are : transactions, customer demographic and customer addresses.
A separate sheet is named new customer list. I should then determine which among the people in the new customer list are potential customers given the past data already provided. 
Step 1: **Data Cleaning**-I began by cleaning my data sets, and in this instance the biggest issue was the null values and outliers. I tried not to delete any observations with null values so as not to remove information that I might need ahead. However, I had to delete outliers as they were messing with my data. 
Step 2: **Feature Engineering**- I then conducted some feature engineering by deriving new columns such as Age, Day, Profit Margin etc in order to glean better insights from the data sets. 
Step 3: **Univariate and Bivariate Analysis** - I conducted univariate and bivariate analysis on each dataset separately in order to understand each. I then conducted bivariate analysis on each data set
Step 4: **Merging the two datasets:** I merged the transactions data set along with the customer demographic in order to conduct both univariate and bivariate analysis on them. 
**Conclusions**
The Following Observations were made;
> There was a very small disparity between men and women. There were slightly more female customers than male customers.
> Most customers worked in the manufacturing industry and earned a normal salary ie were categorized as 'mass customers'.
> Most customers were middle aged ie ages 36-55 with the average age of a customer being 39.8yrs.
> A typical customer is likely to buy a medium, standard solex bicycle. 
> The solex bicycle is the most bought bicycle in terms of numbers but WareA2B bicyle brings in the higest profit margins. 
> The rate of cancellation was very low. 
> Neither the month nor the day of the week seems to have any impact on sales.
> There was almost no difference between online and offline sales both in terms of numbers and profit margin. 
> The ten most regular customers mostly made up the 10 customers who made the most profit. For instance, Corrabelle was the most recurrent customer and she was also the one who brought in the most sales. 
**Recommendations**
>Customers like Corrabelle need some sort of recognition in order to encourage more sales. 
>The company should introduce discounts on repeat purchases in order to encourage them. 
>It is interesting to see more women than men buying bicycles. I feel men should be targeted more as they are likely to buy products of higher value. Men and women are equal in all other wealth segments except mass customers.
